1. Using Terraform, create 3 EC2 instances and put them behind an Elastic Load Balancer
1. Make sure the after applying your plan, Terraform exports the public IP addresses of the 3 instances to a file called host-inventory
1. Get a .com.ng or any other domain name for yourself (be creative, this will be a domain you can keep using) and set it up with AWS Route53 within your terraform plan, then add an A record for subdomain terraform-test that points to your ELB IP address.
1. Create an Ansible script that uses the host-inventory file Terraform created to install Apache, set timezone to Africa/Lagos and displays a simple HTML page that displays content to clearly identify on all 3 EC2 instances.
1. Your project is complete when one visits terraform-test.yoursdmain.com and it shows the content from your instances, while rotating between the servers as your refresh to display their unique content.
1. Submit both the Ansible and Terraform files created

## How to run the project

1. set your credentials as environmental variables.
<pre><code>export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
</code></pre>

</code></pre>
<pre><code>export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
</code></pre>
 it can also be run the way it is in my module, but AWS CLI must first be configured

2. Run the following commands
<pre><code>terraform init
</code></pre>
 The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. 

<pre><code>terraform plan
</code></pre>
 The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan
<pre><code>terraform apply
</code></pre>

The terraform apply command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.

# After provisioning your Infrastructure. 

### Run the Ansible Playbook with below command inside the ansible folder

<pre><code>ansible-playbook -i host-inventory main.yml</code></pre>
